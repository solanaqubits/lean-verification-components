# Public verification record

[Knowledge base](README.md) · [Release v0.5.3](../docs/release-v0.5.3.en.md)

This release contains 105 direct imports, 141 Lean files under Verification/ and
9,074 project declarations. Exact proof-source hashes are recorded in
[validation_snapshot.json](../tools/validation_snapshot.json).

Public validation passed: 3,523 strict build jobs, 40 tests with no skips, and two audits covering 9,074 declarations. Reproduce with:

```bash
lake build --wfail
python3 tools/verifier_skill.py verify-all
LEAN_VERIFIER_LIVE_TESTS=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/check_knowledge.py
python3 scripts/generate_chip_manifest.py --check
```

Both audits permit only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
The pinned independent axiom-audit complements the complete local verifier.
The CLI has no `audit-all` or `test-all` subcommands.

## Operational snapshot scope

DistributedChandyLamportSnapshot derives saved-cut consistency and exact completed-channel contents from two-process FIFO transitions. Open-channel recording has separate received-so-far semantics. There is one snapshot instance; no failures, arbitrary n-node topology, fairness, eventual completion or completion detector are verified.

A fresh public build required removing the unused broad `Mathlib.Tactic` import from the new module. All definitions and proof bodies match private source `520eef27466667237fff4d6ef7d9821e17f9fcfe`; the other 141 Lean files match byte-for-byte. No checks were disabled. See the release report for this source exception.

## Numerical scope

- NumericBinaryGrid supplies the exact binary64 magnitude decoder and parity lemmas.
- NumericRoundingCertificates checks rational interval and exact-midpoint witnesses,
  with signed zero, subnormals and overflow. The mathematical checker is not a
  verification of Python or CPU instructions.
- NumericRealRounding transports rational endpoint certificates to enclosed real values.
- NumericSQLIntervalBounds encloses `sqrt(hbar/(mass*frequency))` under explicit
  positive input intervals and containment hypotheses. Physical calibration is external;
  the separate gap expression is handled by NumericSQLGapBounds.
- NumericSQLGapBounds derives affine gap bounds, exact zero iff balance for positive
  parameters, canonical +0 and composition with real rounding. Rationalization,
  exact cell-boundary comparison and the new SimLab search are not formalized.
- NumericCertificateDigestBridge composes explicit pure digest/parser parameters
  with the mathematical checker. Expected digest, parser, grid and SQL inputs are
  external context. SHA-256, JSON/RFC 8259, Python equivalence, byte binding of those
  inputs and source authenticity are not proved. Digest equality is not byte equality.

Historical indeterminate intervals remain indeterminate. Later exact-midpoint or
exact-zero evidence is separate. No simulation runtime or full simulation archive
is distributed. The curated rounding provenance JSON is external metadata; its
source simulation paths are not included in this package.

The earlier placement certificate retains its exact 256 rational records, boundary
and pairwise-disjointness guarantees. The deterministic converter is checked
externally; its JSON parser and hashing are not Lean-verified.

Scalar MuSig2 does not establish cryptographic security; the forking module proves
an elementary finite-matrix bound, not a general ROM reduction. Visibility does
not prove quantum decoherence. The documented optomechanical approximation regime
is not derived in Lean. Historical hundred-module aggregation preserves these limits.
